# Advanced Git for Astronomers part 3: working with several branches

Welcome to **workflow 3** of the "Advanced Git for Astronomers" tutorial!

With this repository, we  will be learning how to manage several active branches at a time on a repository. We will 
see how merge conflicts arise, how to solve them, and how to work in a way that tries to avoid them in the first place, 
as best as possible.

We will also work through an example that shows how to provide a "conda recipe" for a Python installation that 
is needed to run the code on your repository.
